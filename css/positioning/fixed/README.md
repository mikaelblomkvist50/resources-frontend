When I hear this element is `positioned: fixed;` I think that the elements width and height will be  shrink-wrap around the content. The fixed positioned element will move up of the page and the In normal flow content below will move up to where the fixed position element was positioned before hand. Also the top 0 and bottom 0 will be relative to the view port not its closeset parent.
