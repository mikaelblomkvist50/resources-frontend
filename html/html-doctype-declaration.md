`<!DOCTYPE html>` is technically not a html element but an instruction to the browser about what version of html the page is written in. So with this declaration, I just told the browser that this file will be html5. - [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/learn/v4/t/lecture/2534570?start=0s)

`<!DOCTYPE html>` this right here is sort of special tag because as you guys can see we're not including any closing tag after woulds. But just defining at the very top of the document that this is a html file and not just any kind of html file. But the way we wrote it actually tell the browser that this is a html5 document.
